"""Template size guardrails for injected bootstrap context.

The source .j2 files contain multiple branches (main/lead/worker) but only one
is rendered per agent. We check the RENDERED output for each variant with
realistic provisioning context (matching what ``_build_context`` injects at
runtime) because the gateway injects the rendered markdown into the model's
bootstrap context.

The hard cap aligns with the OpenClaw docs at
https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/context which declare
``agents.defaults.bootstrapMaxChars = 20000`` as the per-file cap and
``agents.defaults.bootstrapTotalMaxChars = 150000`` as the total-across-files
cap. Files over the per-file cap get truncated by the gateway, which would
silently drop instructions. The previous ``HEARTBEAT_CONTEXT_LIMIT = 10_500``
guard was fake — nothing in the runtime enforced that number, it was just
test hygiene from a prior era — and it rendered with minimal context so it
lied about headroom. This test now uses the documented runtime contract and
realistic context matching ``_build_context``.
