"""Tests for the rejection-loop guard + unblock endpoint.

Covers the v2 design that replaced the spoofable v1 ``@miguel`` string
match. Properties exercised:

- Three consecutive rejections on the same task return 409.
- An ``approved`` event in the middle of a rejection streak resets the
  counter.
- The authenticated ``unblock`` endpoint (human user) clears the loop
  and the next submission is allowed.
- Ordinary worker agents cannot unblock; only board leads and humans.
- The loop guard is per-task, not board-global: rejections on task A
  do not block task B.
- String-matching spoof attempts (payload or comment) no longer work.
