"""Pipeline-event POST must reject when ``task.status == "rework"``.

Repro from 2026-05-03 (E.3 ``f892fd65``): Programmer-Frontend posted six
``pipeline/events`` while the task was still in ``rework`` (200 OK on each
POST), then PATCHed ``rework → in_progress``. The cycle anchor reset to
the new ``in_progress_at``, and the previously-posted events fell *outside*
the new cycle window — silently invisible to ``pipeline.ready`` /
``auto_resolve_pipeline_blockers_if_ready``. PF had to repost the same six
events to refill the new cycle.

Cycle scope is load-bearing for Phase V §I9 Fix 2 (it prevents stale-event
auto-resolve, the inverse of the AC5 failure mode), so the cycle reset must
stay. The fix is to reject the POST upstream — surface the workflow
violation at the *first* offending event, not silently after five wasted
events. The error directs the agent to PATCH ``rework → in_progress``
first, which is the only ``_AGENT_PATH_VALID_TRANSITIONS`` predecessor
of the next ``review`` submission.

Invariant pinned by these tests:
- POST /pipeline/events while ``status="rework"`` returns 409 with
  ``code=pipeline_event_requires_in_progress``.
- Every other status keeps current permissive behavior — ``in_progress``,
  ``review``, ``done`` all still accept POSTs (the gate is narrow on
  purpose; broadening would cascade into late-deploy verification flows).
