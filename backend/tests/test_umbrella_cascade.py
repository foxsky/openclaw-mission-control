"""Umbrella auto-cascade — when the last child of a never-executed
umbrella reaches terminal status, the umbrella itself must auto-cancel.

Repro 2026-05-03: ``a8a67bc8`` (Phase 2.5 Stats + trust-line truth packet)
was decomposed into 5 child tasks (AC1-AC5). All children eventually
reached ``done``, but the umbrella sat in ``inbox`` indefinitely with
``is_blocked=False`` (deps satisfied) and no assignee — pure queue
pollution that surfaced as "why is this stuck?" in the operator's
dashboard view.

Invariant pinned by these tests:
- Last sibling reaching done/cancelled triggers parent auto-cancel
- Cascade ONLY fires when parent has never been executed (no
  ``in_progress_at`` AND no ``previous_in_progress_at``)
- Cascade does not touch parents that are already terminal
- Cascade does not touch parents whose siblings are still active
- Tasks with no parent are no-ops
