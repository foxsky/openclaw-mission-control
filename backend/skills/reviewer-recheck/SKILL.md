description: Use when a QA, Architect, or review-only verdict has been challenged, rejected, or returned for correction on the same task.

# Reviewer Recheck

Use this only for validation/review roles correcting or defending a prior
verdict. Do not implement, deploy, move implementation status, or resubmit
worker output.

## Rules

- Quote the challenge or rejection verbatim.
- Compare commits, build, target, and evidence since the previous verdict.
- Re-test the disputed acceptance criteria from a clean state.
- If no new commit/evidence exists after a code-related FAIL, keep FAIL:
  `no code changed since previous QA` or
  `no code/evidence changed since previous review`.
- Re-citing a previous PASS is forbidden.
- After the corrected comment, use `structured-review-verdict`. The API wakes
  the lead after storing the structured event; do not add a separate nudge.

## QA Recheck Format

```text
QA RECHECK for $TASK_ID:
  Challenge/rejection quoted: "<paste issue word-for-word>"
  Target/source tested: <url + source commit SHA matching live /__build.sha; do NOT cite asset filename hash>
  Re-test evidence: <literal browser/command output>
  Corrected verdict: PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE/INFRA BLOCKED
  @lead <one-line routing intent — see "Required @ citation" below>
  Lead wake: structured-review-verdict review event
```

Map `INFRA BLOCKED` to `infra_blocked` when posting the structured event.

## Architect Recheck Format

```text
ARCHITECT RECHECK for $TASK_ID:
  Challenge/rejection quoted: "<paste issue word-for-word>"
  Previous verdict: PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE on <packet/build>
  New evidence reviewed: <commit/build/evidence packet or "none">
  Diff from previous: <one-line summary, e.g. "AC3 lighthouserc threshold
                       fixed; AC1 still missing webp coverage" or
                       "scope unchanged, evidence updated">
  Corrected verdict: PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE
  Blocking findings: <list or "none">
  Evidence gaps: <list or "none">
  @lead <one-line routing intent — see "Required @ citation" below>
  Lead wake: structured-review-verdict review event
```

The `Diff from previous` line replaces the fragility of a per-AC delta
column — Architect findings often regress on one dimension and improve
on another, which a single classification can't capture. A one-line
narrative summary lets the lead/operator scan the change without
parsing a column of mostly `unchanged` entries.

If the corrected verdict changes required roles, blocking owner, or routing,
include those fields in the structured review event.

## Required @ citation

Every recheck comment (QA or Architect) MUST end with `@lead` (or
`@Supervisor` — both refer to the board lead and the backend treats
them as equivalent) plus a one-line routing intent BEFORE the
`Lead wake:` line. The structured `/review-events` API auto-wakes
the lead for routing logic, but the prose comment is what the
operator sees in the dashboard, agent text dumps, and scrollback.
Without an explicit citation, the wake is invisible to the
human-facing channel.

**Routing-intent shapes** (same as the original verdict skills):

- Corrected PASS, all required reviewer roles now passing →
  `@lead approve and move to done`
- Corrected PASS, more reviewers still need to run →
  `@lead @<NextReviewer> next gate is <role>`
- Corrected FAIL →
  `@lead move to rework for <owner> (<one-line reason>)`
- INCONCLUSIVE / packet-missing →
  `@lead route DevOps/operator (<reason>)`
