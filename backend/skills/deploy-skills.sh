# Deploy MC-side skills to the gateway at .60.
#
# Skills live on the gateway at /root/.openclaw/skills/ and are auto-discovered
# by openclaw via load.watch:true (no allow-list, no Sync API call needed).
# Filesystem watch picks up changes within ~250ms of write.
#
# Usage:
#   ./deploy-skills.sh           # rsync local skills to .60 (no deletes)
#   ./deploy-skills.sh --prune   # also delete prod-only skills not in local
#   ./deploy-skills.sh --dry     # show what would change, do not write
#
# CI runs the no-flag form from the self-hosted runner on every master push
# touching backend/skills/** (.github/workflows/deploy.yml). --prune and
# --dry remain manual-only.
#
# Source of truth: this directory. Anything under here syncs upward.
# Anything on .60 not under here is left alone unless --prune is passed.
