description: Use when a board lead has cleared next-action and memory-intake gates and must choose one closest-to-done board friction to route.

# Lead Health Scan

Use this only as a board lead, after `lead-next-action-gate` and
`lead-memory-intake` have cleared or their required action has been applied or
parked.

            print(f"{p}_ID={i} {tag}")

If a generated curl returns 404, schema mismatch, or an unexpected 4xx,
refresh OpenAPI per `TOOLS.md` and derive the current agent-lead endpoint
instead of guessing.

## Closest-To-Done Order

Choose one task, route one friction, then stop:

1. approved review tasks that still need a done transition
2. review tasks missing exactly one required gate
3. assigned rework with a clear owner and failing dimension
4. stale `in_progress` work with no represented blocker
5. unassigned `inbox` work that can be routed or decomposed

Age tells you where to inspect; it does not justify reminder comments. Use
agent UUIDs from the scan, not `$AGENT_ID`.

## Routing Rules

- If the next action is owned and executable, let the owner work. Do not post a
  hold comment.
- If the first friction is runtime/deploy/source/contract friction (missing
  deploy/live target, credential, source artifact, API endpoint, or validation
  evidence), create or reuse one structured `Blocker` on the task with
  `reason_code`, `owner_role`, and the narrowest useful
  `required_artifact`/`target_env`/`reopen_condition`. **Then post one
  human-readable task comment alongside the Blocker** (see "Required
  visibility comment" below). Route one owner action and stop touching that
  task thread until the blocker resolves.
- If the first friction is a human/operator choice, create or reuse one
  first-class `OperatorDecision`, link dependent tasks, **post one
  human-readable task comment naming the decision and the operator question**
  (same visibility rule as Blockers), and stop touching those task threads
  until the decision resolves.
- Do not set legacy `operator_decision_required` on active assigned work.
- If the first friction is code/test/review feedback, classify the owner first,
  then move exactly that task through `rework -> in_progress -> review`.
- Offline agent with live task: recover once, then assign the task elsewhere if
  it still cannot move.

Do not post another "still blocked" comment. A comment is not routing.

## Required visibility comment when filing a Blocker or OperatorDecision

When you create a structured `Blocker` (or first-class `OperatorDecision`)
via the API, you MUST also post one human-readable task comment naming
what was filed and why. The structured row exists in `/blockers` and
`/operator-decisions` API responses, but the operator/dashboard reading
the prose comment scroll has no inline view of the new entity. A blocker
that "appears out of nowhere" is the exact UX failure mode the
2026-05-03 QA gate incident produced.

**Comment format** (one comment per Blocker/OperatorDecision filed):

```text
BLOCKER FILED: <reason_code>
Owner: <owner_role> (@<agent name or operator>)
Required artifact: <one-line summary of required_artifact>
Reopen when: <one-line summary of reopen_condition>
Citation: <one-line summary of citation, including request_id if from a 4xx>
```

For OperatorDecisions, replace `BLOCKER FILED` with `OPERATOR DECISION
FILED` and use the decision's question/options shape.

**Why mandatory:** the structured row drives `/lead/next-action` routing
correctly, but operators/operators-dashboards/Slack-pipes that consume
prose comments would otherwise see a task transition to `is_blocked=true`
without context, and start asking "where did this come from?" The paired
comment is one short block (5 lines using the template above) — cheap
insurance against the visibility gap.

**Forbidden duplicate:** do NOT also post a separate "still blocked"
nudge later in the same loop iteration. The one filing comment IS the
visibility surface; subsequent ticks should NOT re-comment unless the
Blocker reason changes (per "Do not post another 'still blocked'
comment" rule above).

## Stale Operator-Blocker Revalidation

When the scan finds a task with `is_blocked=true`, check whether the
underlying blocker can be revalidated rather than left waiting
indefinitely. The agent task-scan endpoint
(`/api/v1/agent/boards/$BOARD_ID/tasks`) returns each task with two
inline lists:

- `open_blocker_reason_codes` — codes from open structured `Blocker` rows
- `pending_operator_decision_reason_codes` — codes from pending
  `OperatorDecision` entities linked to the task

The task is also blocked if `operator_decision_required=true` (the legacy
boolean on `Task` that predates the structured entities). Such tasks
have no `reason_code` to dispatch on — they appear in the scan with
`is_blocked=true` but both code lists empty. Treat them as the **legacy
unstructured class** below.

### Per-code revalidation threshold and action

| `reason_code` | Stale-after | Probe + action |
|---|---|---|
| `gateway_ws_timeout` | 6h | Probe gateway WS handshake; if `HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols` returns within 5 seconds, post one comment: `REVALIDATION_CANDIDATE reason_code=gateway_ws_timeout: gateway WS healthy at <ts>; @<assigned_owner> please retry one ACP spawn per acp-delegation § WS Timeout Idempotency, then update the blocker.` |
| `deploy_drift` | 6h | If the live target's loaded build hash now matches the source-of-truth commit, post `REVALIDATION_CANDIDATE reason_code=deploy_drift: live build matches source at <commit>; @DevOps confirm and resolve blocker.` |
| `external_dependency` | 24h | Post `REVALIDATION_CANDIDATE reason_code=external_dependency: <ageH>h old; @<owner> please confirm dependency status.` |
| `operator_policy`, `requirements_clarification`, `credential_required`, `infra_other` | n/a | Durable human decisions — do **not** auto-revalidate. Surface in the daily operator digest only. |
| unknown / null | n/a | Do not auto-revalidate. The canonical recognised set lives in `app/services/blocker_reason_codes.py`; treat anything else as opaque. |

The 24h threshold for `external_dependency` is intentionally longer than
the 6h infra threshold — vendor waits are normal; nudging at 6h would
spam. Codes not yet listed here default to "do not auto-revalidate".

### Legacy unstructured class

A task with `is_blocked=true`, both reason-code lists empty, AND
`operator_decision_required=true` is a legacy row from before the
structured `reason_code` field landed (alembic `f2b3c4d5e6a7`). The
skill cannot probe it — there's no machine signal to act on. **Surface
it once per 24h** with:

```
LEGACY_BLOCKED_TASK_NEEDS_TRIAGE: task=<id> updated_at=<ts> assigned=<owner>
@<lead> structured reason_code is missing on this task. Inspect the
latest blocker comment, file a `Blocker` or `OperatorDecision` with a
recognised `reason_code`, and resolve `operator_decision_required` so
revalidation dispatch can act on this task in the future.
```

This converts the legacy gap into a queue rather than a silent miss.

### Anti-spam rules

- Post at most one `REVALIDATION_CANDIDATE` (or `LEGACY_BLOCKED_TASK_NEEDS_TRIAGE`)
  comment per task per the per-code stale-after window. If a prior
  comment of the same kind exists newer than that window, skip and proceed
  to the next task. (Implementation: read the most recent N task
  comments for the marker prefix; compare timestamps. Use the
  comment-stream endpoint, not memory.)
- Never clear `operator_decision_required`, never `PATCH`
  `Blocker.resolved_at`, and never close an `OperatorDecision` from this
  skill — only the blocker's owner or operator can resolve.
- If the probe fails (gateway still unhealthy, build hash still
  mismatched), do not post anything. Silence is the correct signal that
  the blocker is still active.
- If a task carries multiple codes (one Blocker + one OperatorDecision),
  pick the highest-priority code per this order:
  `gateway_ws_timeout > deploy_drift > external_dependency > operator_durable codes > legacy`. Do
  not post one comment per code — one task, one revalidation candidate.
