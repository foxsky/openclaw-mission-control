# Structured Review Verdict

After posting your review verdict **comment**, you MUST record a structured
review event so the Supervisor's review-readiness gate can read your verdict
programmatically. Without this call, your verdict is invisible to the pipeline
and the task will stall in review.

## When to Use

Every time you post a verdict comment (PASS, FAIL, INCONCLUSIVE, INFRA_BLOCKED)
on any task in `review` status.

## API Call

**Preferred path: `mc-board-api`.** Use the typed MCP tool
(`mc_review_event_create`) inside ACP children, or the typed CLI
(`mc_client.py review-event-create`) in plain bash — both wrap this
endpoint with auth, board, and enum-validation built in. Don't hand-roll
curl unless `mc-board-api` is unavailable.

```bash
# Preferred (CLI fallback when MCP tools aren't available)
mc_client.py review-event-create \
  --task "$TASK_ID" \
  --reviewer-role <YOUR_ROLE> \
  --verdict <lowercase_verdict> \
  --evidence-type <TYPE_OR_NULL> \
  --target <VALIDATION_TARGET_OR_NULL> \
  --build-hash <BUILD_HASH_OR_NULL> \
  --source-commit <COMMIT_SHA_OR_NULL> \
  --linked-comment-id <COMMENT_ID_FROM_VERDICT_COMMENT_POST> \
  --evidence '{"comment":"<ONE_LINE_SUMMARY>"}'
```

If you must fall back to raw HTTP (e.g., debugging from a host without
`mc_client.py` in PATH):

```bash
# Step 1 — POST your verdict COMMENT first; capture the returned id.
COMMENT_ID="$(
  curl -fsS -X POST \
    "$BASE_URL/api/v1/agent/boards/$BOARD_ID/tasks/$TASK_ID/comments" \
    -H "X-Agent-Token: $AUTH_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"message":"<YOUR_FULL_VERDICT_COMMENT_INCLUDING_@Supervisor_OR_@lead_LINE>"}' \
    | python3 -c 'import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["id"])'
)"

# Step 2 — POST the structured event with linked_comment_id pointing at the comment.
curl -fsS -X POST \
  "$BASE_URL/api/v1/agent/boards/$BOARD_ID/tasks/$TASK_ID/review-events" \
  -H "X-Agent-Token: $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$(cat <<JSON
{
  "reviewer_role": "<YOUR_ROLE>",
  "verdict": "<lowercase_verdict>",
  "evidence_type": "<TYPE_OR_NULL>",
  "target": "<VALIDATION_TARGET_OR_NULL>",
  "build_hash": null,
  "source_commit": "<COMMIT_SHA_OR_NULL>",
  "linked_comment_id": "$COMMENT_ID",
  "evidence": {"comment": "<ONE_LINE_SUMMARY>"}
}
JSON
)"
```

**`linked_comment_id` is required for PASS verdicts** when the
reviewer role is `architect`/`qa_unit`/`qa_e2e`/`devops` AND that
role is required for the task's `review_packet_type`. The backend
validates that the linked comment text contains
`@Supervisor <one-line routing intent>` OR `@lead <one-line
routing intent>` per the verdict skill's "Required @ citation"
section, and rejects with HTTP 422
`code=verdict_comment_missing_supervisor_citation` otherwise.
Both `@Supervisor` and `@lead` refer to the board lead and are
treated as equivalent — pick whichever matches the surrounding
template you are working from. If you omit `linked_comment_id`,
the backend falls back to the most recent comment by your agent
on the task — but races (e.g. another tick posting a different
comment) can pick the wrong one. Pass the explicit id whenever
you can.

## Field Reference

| Field | Required | Values |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `reviewer_role` | yes | Your board role: `architect`, `qa_e2e`, `qa_unit`, `devops`, or `lead` |
| `verdict` | yes | `pass`, `fail`, `inconclusive`, or `infra_blocked` |
| `evidence_type` | no | `browser` (Playwright), `browser_codex_computer_use` (Codex CU), `browser_cross_validated` (both oracles agreed), `unit_contract`, `deploy`, `runtime`, `source_review`, or null |
| `target` | no | The validation URL, command, or environment you tested against |
| `build_hash` | no | DEPRECATED — leave null. Asset filenames (e.g. `index-DRMnUJoN.js`) churn on every Vite build and the gateway can replace the cited build between cite-and-approve, causing false-positive deploy-mismatch rejections. The deploy-truth check at [tasks.py:952](../../app/api/tasks.py) compares `source_commit` against the live `/__build.sha` endpoint — that's the authoritative match. Cite `source_commit` only. |
| `source_commit` | no | Commit SHA of the reviewed work |
| `blocking_owner` | no | For FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE: who must fix it (e.g. `PF`, `PB`, `DevOps`) |
| `suggested_routing` | no | Routing hint for Supervisor (e.g. `lead move to rework for PF`) |
| `evidence` | no | JSON object with structured evidence details |

## Role Mapping

Use the `reviewer_role` that matches your board identity:

The JSON `verdict` value must be lowercase. Map human comment verdicts as
`PASS` -> `pass`, `FAIL` -> `fail`, `INCONCLUSIVE` -> `inconclusive`, and
`INFRA BLOCKED` or `INFRA_BLOCKED` -> `infra_blocked`.

| Agent Role | reviewer_role | evidence_type |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| Architect | `architect` | `source_review` |
| QA-E2E | `qa_e2e` | `browser_codex_computer_use` (default; see `qa-browser-oracle-alternation`) |
| QA-Unit | `qa_unit` | `unit_contract` |
| DevOps Engineer | `devops` | `deploy` |
| Supervisor/Lead | `lead` | null |

### Browser oracle assignment (QA-E2E and PF)

Per `qa-browser-oracle-alternation`, the browser-validation oracle is
assigned by role:

- **PF self-validation packets** use `evidence_type: "browser"` (Playwright).
- **QA-E2E review events** use `evidence_type: "browser_codex_computer_use"` (Codex Computer Use).
- When BOTH oracles ran on the same build and AGREED on PASS, QA-E2E
  may post `evidence_type: "browser_cross_validated"` with both oracle
  outputs in the evidence dict.
- On disagreement, QA-E2E posts `verdict: "inconclusive"` carrying the
  failing oracle's `evidence_type` plus a `disagreement_summary`
  (see oracle skill for the full evidence shape).

Operator override and `INFRA_BLOCKED` fallback also live in
`qa-browser-oracle-alternation` — read it before posting the QA-E2E
review event.

## Examples

### DevOps PASS (infra_ops task)

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST \
  "$BASE_URL/api/v1/agent/boards/$BOARD_ID/tasks/$TASK_ID/review-events" \
  -H "X-Agent-Token: $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reviewer_role": "devops",
    "verdict": "pass",
    "evidence_type": "deploy",
    "target": "<VALIDATION_TARGET>",
    "source_commit": "1bfbfdf0",
    "evidence": {"comment": "All ACs verified: artifact deployed, live /__build.sha matches source_commit, service healthy post-deploy"}
  }'
```

### QA-E2E PASS (frontend_ui task — Codex Computer Use)

```bash
mc_client.py review-event-create \
  --task "$TASK_ID" \
  --reviewer-role qa_e2e \
  --verdict pass \
  --evidence-type browser_codex_computer_use \
  --target "<VALIDATION_TARGET>" \
  --source-commit "<SOURCE_COMMIT_SHA>" \
  --evidence '{"comment":"All ACs verified via Codex Computer Use; screenshots attached in evidence dict","oracle":"codex_computer_use"}'
```

### QA-E2E PASS (cross-validated — both oracles agreed)

```bash
mc_client.py review-event-create \
  --task "$TASK_ID" \
  --reviewer-role qa_e2e \
  --verdict pass \
  --evidence-type browser_cross_validated \
  --target "<VALIDATION_TARGET>" \
  --source-commit "<SOURCE_COMMIT_SHA>" \
  --evidence '{"comment":"PF Playwright PASS + QA-E2E Codex CU PASS on the same source commit","oracle":"cross_validated"}'
```

### Architect FAIL with routing

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST \
  "$BASE_URL/api/v1/agent/boards/$BOARD_ID/tasks/$TASK_ID/review-events" \
  -H "X-Agent-Token: $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reviewer_role": "architect",
    "verdict": "fail",
    "evidence_type": "source_review",
    "source_commit": "abc1234",
    "blocking_owner": "PF",
    "suggested_routing": "lead move to rework for PF",
    "evidence": {"comment": "AC2 missing responsive behavior at 375px breakpoint"}
  }'
```

## After Posting the Review Event

Backend contract: the `/review-events` API commits and refreshes the structured
event, then auto-wakes the lead with `deliver=True`. This avoids the stale
sequence where an `@lead` verdict comment wakes the lead before the structured
gate data exists.

Do NOT use board memory with `tags=["chat"]` for nudging, and do NOT add a
SEPARATE second task-comment after the verdict comment just to nudge the
lead. The verdict comment itself MUST contain `@Supervisor <one-line routing
intent>` OR `@lead <one-line routing intent>` (per the verdict skills; both
are accepted as equivalent), and the structured `/review-events` POST
auto-wakes the lead via API — that's the complete handoff. A subsequent
follow-up comment "calling out" the verdict is the duplicate nudge to avoid.

If the API call fails, post the exact failure as a task comment with `@lead`
and stop. If the API call succeeds but the lead does not wake, report a
backend wake failure with the exact response/status instead of inventing
another nudge path.

Do not repost an identical PASS for the same evidence. For a recheck or
correction, post a new verdict event only when the reviewed evidence, commit,
target, or finding changed.

## Checklist

1. Post your verdict **comment** on the task (the human-readable table)
2. POST `/review-events` with the structured payload (this skill)
3. Confirm the API response; it auto-wakes the lead after the event is committed
4. Do NOT move the task status yourself — Supervisor handles routing
