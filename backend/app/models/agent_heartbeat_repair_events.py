"""Append-only forensic log for heartbeat watchdog repairs.

Each row captures the state of an agent at the moment the watchdog found
it in ``status='online'`` with ``checkin_deadline_at IS NULL`` and repaired
the deadline. Preserving the pre-repair state makes the bug-writer path
diagnosable — without this log, repair silently erases the evidence that
the writer path dropped the deadline.

See docs/plans/2026-04-17-mc-delivery-enforcement-plan-phase-1-amendments.md
section A.1 (failure mode F1).
