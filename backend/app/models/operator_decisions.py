"""OperatorDecision + OperatorDecisionTaskLink models (plan §I3).

Phase III §I3: operator decisions become first-class entities. The
legacy ``Task.operator_decision_required`` + ``operator_decision_summary``
flags keep working during the migration — this phase adds the new
entity without removing the old shape. The is_blocked derivation
will OR over both sources so a task is blocked if either the flag
or a pending ``OperatorDecision`` linked through this sidecar is open.

See docs/plans/2026-04-16-mc-delivery-enforcement-plan.md §I3 and
§"Phase III — Operator-decision compatibility bridge".
