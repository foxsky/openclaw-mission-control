"""Phase V §I8 capability-based deploy-truth helpers.

When a task carries ``supports_build_metadata=True``, the reviewer is
claiming the target exposes ``GET /__build`` and that the task's
``packet_commit_sha`` matches what's live. This module:

- fetches the target's ``/__build`` response,
- normalises the payload into ``BuildMetadata``,
- compares the claimed packet SHA with the live SHA under the
  same abbreviated-SHA rules the schema validator enforces.

Degraded-validation (``supports_build_metadata`` is ``False`` or
``None``) is handled at the caller — this module only owns the
capable-target code path.
