"""Lightweight protocol constants shared by the OpenClaw gateway RPC
client and the long-lived event subscriber.

Intentionally has NO dependencies on ``app.core.*`` (config, logging,
settings) so worker processes that consume only protocol constants —
e.g. ``mc_gateway_subscriber`` running under systemd with a minimal
env — can import them without instantiating the full FastAPI
``Settings`` object.

Keep this module dependency-free. If a constant needs computed
state, derive it lazily in the call site, not here.
