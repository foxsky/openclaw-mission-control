"""Phase VI §I6 blocked-lane comment suppression.

Once a task has any acknowledged open blocker, comments from non-
owner agents are suppressed unless:

- the commenter is the task owner (``task.assigned_agent_id``),
- the commenter is a human operator (``ActorContext.actor_type ==
  "user"``),
- the board has not yet graduated past the legacy behaviour
  (``rollout_flags["structured_blockers_v1"]`` is absent / False).

The rule stops the "duplicate FAIL under a known blocker" noise
pattern that drove the original incident. It does not replace the
Phase I comment-classifier filter — that one hides rows from reads;
this one rejects the write altogether.

Refinements deferred to follow-up commits:
- "blocker owner posts canonical summary once" exception
- "blocker record changed since commenter's last turn" exception

    The rule:

    2. Task has at least one open, *acknowledged* ``Blocker`` row.
       Acknowledgement is the operator signal that "the routing has
       been received" — unacknowledged blockers still need traffic
       so the owner can pick them up.
    3. Comment author is an agent (``author_agent_id`` is not None).
       User-token callers (operators) are exempt; humans can always
       comment on a blocked lane.
    4. Comment author is NOT the task's assigned owner. The owner is
       the one party that may legitimately post progress / resolve
       updates while the lane is otherwise quiet.
