"""Phase VI §I5 lead heartbeat no-op scoring.

A lead heartbeat only scores as success if it produced at least one
of the four action categories the plan enumerates. Commentary alone
is a no-op; two consecutive no-op scorings trigger the operator
alert.

Attribution strategy (v1, three of four categories):
- ``Blocker`` rows where ``created_by_agent_id`` matches the lead
  (clean attribution via Phase II).
- ``ActivityEvent`` rows with ``event_type`` in the mutation set
  below AND ``agent_id`` matching the lead.

The "dependency graph changed" category is deferred — ``task_dependencies``
currently has no ``created_by`` column, so attribution would be
noisy. v2 can add that column and expand the scoring.

Bookmark strategy: derived from shadow_metric_events. ``last_scored_at``
is ``MAX(created_at)`` over the noop-candidate + streak-alert event
types for the lead. No new state columns — the metric table IS the
truth. Matches the A+X choice from the design brainstorm.

Streak detection: before emitting a candidate, read whether the most
recent prior candidate for the lead is within the last sweep window
(2× configured interval gives us "consecutive heartbeats" tolerance
even if one sweep pass was skipped). If yes, emit the streak-alert
row alongside the candidate.
