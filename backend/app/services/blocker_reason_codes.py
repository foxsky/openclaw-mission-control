"""Canonical reason-code registry for blockers and operator decisions.

The DB column is open-vocabulary (no CHECK constraint, no Pydantic Literal)
so new codes can be added without a schema migration. This module is the
runtime source of truth for which codes the platform RECOGNISES — used by:

- the `lead-health-scan` skill's revalidation dispatch
- (planned, Phase IV-A) `strict` enforcement that 422s agent-filed
  blockers carrying unknown codes for runtime/deploy categories

Operators can post any string they want; the DB accepts it. Agents
filing programmatic blockers should restrict themselves to the
recognised set so revalidation logic has something to act on.

When adding a new code:

1. Add it here with a classification.
2. Add a probe rule to `lead-health-scan` SKILL.md if it's auto-revalidatable.
3. Add a test in `tests/test_blocker_reason_codes.py`.
