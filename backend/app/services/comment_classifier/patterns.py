"""Regex patterns and packet-type taxonomy for the comment classifier.

Kept in its own module so the calibration script at
``scripts/calibrate_comment_classifier.py`` can import patterns without
pulling in the full classifier dependency tree, and so rule tuning is a
focused diff against a single file.

Helpers are package-public (no leading underscore) because they are
imported by the sibling ``classifier`` module. The module as a whole is
an implementation detail of ``app.services.comment_classifier``.
