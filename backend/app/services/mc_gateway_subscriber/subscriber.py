"""WebSocket subscriber for OpenClaw gateway events.

Implements the gateway connect handshake observed in
``app/services/openclaw/gateway_rpc.py`` (frame shapes: ``req``,
``res``, ``event``; first message from the gateway is
``connect.challenge`` with a nonce). After the handshake, sends each
configured subscription as its own ``req`` and then loops on incoming
``event`` messages, dispatching to handlers registered with
``.on(event_name, fn)``.

Designed to run as a long-lived asyncio task inside a dedicated
``mc-gateway-subscriber`` worker process.

Failure model:
- Handler exceptions are logged and the loop continues.
- WS connection drops trigger reconnect with exponential backoff
  (capped). Backoff resets only after a connection has been alive long
  enough to be considered healthy — guards against post-handshake
  immediate-close storms (e.g. bad token, role mismatch).
- Caller signals shutdown by setting an ``asyncio.Event``; the
  subscriber closes its WS and returns from ``run()`` cleanly.
