"""Postgres-backed projector for ``sessions.changed`` event frames.

Drop-in replacement for the in-memory ``SessionStateProjector`` in the
worker entry point. Enforces last-write-wins ts ordering before each
write so reconnect-replay snapshots can't regress persisted state.

Earlier slices also carried a "skip if every projected field equals
the existing row" diff guard intended to cut heartbeat-tick write
amplification. Codex review surfaced that the guard breaks ordering:
when a same-field newer event is dropped, the persisted ``last_changed_at_ms``
stays at the older value, so a later out-of-order frame with truly
older content but a slightly newer ts than the persisted one can
pass the ts compare and overwrite the row with stale state. At the
real event rate (~1 event per agent per 10s heartbeat) the saved
write is trivially cheap, so the guard is gone.
