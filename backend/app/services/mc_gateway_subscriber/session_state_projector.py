"""First gateway-event projector.

Consumes ``sessions.changed`` events from the OpenClaw gateway (via the
long-lived ``Subscriber``) and maintains an in-memory map of per-session
runtime state keyed by ``(agent_id, session_label)``. MC API endpoints
read from a shared instance to surface real-time session activity in
lead signals (e.g. ``/agent/next-action``).

Design notes:

* The projector is intentionally process-local with no persistence.
  Slice 4 will add a persistence adapter; keeping the contract minimal
  here means the API layer can ship against the in-memory store and
  switch storage transparently later.
* The handler MUST NOT raise. The dispatcher in ``Subscriber`` already
  swallows exceptions, but a quiet drop is preferable to spamming the
  log on every malformed event — and we want to keep the connection
  healthy even when the gateway emits new event variants we haven't
  modelled yet.
* Out-of-order events are dropped (last-write-wins by ``ts``). Without
  this guard, a reconnect that replays an older snapshot would make
  lead signals flap between stale and current state.
