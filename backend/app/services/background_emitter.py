"""Shared fire-and-forget background-task emitter.

Pulls the bounded-strong-ref pattern used by the Phase 0 shadow-metric
emit out of ``api/tasks.py`` so new signals (Phase V deploy-truth
degraded, Phase VI lane-quieting ticks, etc.) can reuse it instead of
hand-rolling the same 128-slot backlog + task set + done-callback +
drain routine.

Usage:

    _emitter = BackgroundEmitter(name="my_signal", max_pending=128)

    def schedule_my_signal(...) -> None:
        _emitter.schedule(my_emit_coroutine(...), log_key=str(task_id))

    async def lifespan_shutdown() -> None:
        await _emitter.drain()

Each emitter holds strong references to pending tasks so asyncio
doesn't garbage-collect them mid-flight (which would produce "Task
was destroyed but it is pending" warnings). Completed tasks are
auto-discarded via a done callback. The ``max_pending`` cap drops
new signals rather than piling up unbounded under a slow-DB storm.
